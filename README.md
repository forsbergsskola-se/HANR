# Harmony's Ascendance: Nature's Rebirth

You arrive in a world shrouded in darkness where an environmental imbalance disrupted the harmony of nature. Dark creatures roam the realms and feed off the little light that's left. As you explore the realms of Forest, Ocean, Desert, and Wind, you gain the ability to heal or revitalise parts of the environment that have been damaged or corrupted.

Our vertical slice of Harmony's Ascendance: Nature's Rebirth aims to show a quest of healing nature and a boss fight with a Dark Creature.
